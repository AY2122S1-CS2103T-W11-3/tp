Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
    * addMod command
    * deleteMod command
    * listLink command
    * findLink command
    * openLink command which supports both web url and local file path

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()
